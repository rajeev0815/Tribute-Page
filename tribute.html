               <li> Walt's fortune is built on the premise that he's selling his meth at the modest price of about $60 a gram.
             "The price of meth varies wildly from one part of the country to another, and from one time a year to another,
              depending on supplies," he added. "It can go from $50 a gram to $150 a gram. It makes oil prices look stable."</li>

            <li> It's a long way from $60 for a gram of meth to the seven, 55-gallon drums of cash Walt has holding $80 million. </li>
             
              
            <li> Walt cooks almost 400 gallons of the methylamine before deciding to quit the business. He agrees to pay 
                another drug dealer a 35% cut of his sales in return for handling the distribution.</li>

            <li> That would net Walt between $78 million to $96 million in profit, or enough to fill those seven 55-gallon drums with cash.</li>
